In React Native, a subtle bug can occur when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  If the items within the `FlatList` change frequently and the `keyExtractor` function isn't properly implemented, React Native might struggle to efficiently update the list. This can lead to performance issues, such as slow scrolling, dropped frames, or even crashes. The problem might manifest only under certain conditions, such as rapid data updates or when the list is scrolled to a specific section.
